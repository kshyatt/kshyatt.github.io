      <description>A Journey Through Laziness Quite often, I&amp;rsquo;m working at my desktop in my campus office. The compute cluster on campus does not allow me to SSH directly to nodes or to spawn jobs, so usually you SSH into the head node and queue the jobs (which may be julia jobs, if I want to run some fancy parallel Julia code).
This is kind of a pain, so I tried out using ClusterManagers.</description>

      <description>Introduction I get a lot of people who say they want to start contributing to Julia. I link to our spot on Up For Grabs and Iain Dunning&amp;rsquo;s great Contribute To Julia repo. But we don&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of new people opening PRs. I started out a year ago, opening my first PR, and I was so scared. I had no idea what I was doing! Now, I have more than 200 commits to Julia master.</description>
